# Google drives

## Community baseline

| PRIORITY <br /> (ASC) | PRIORITY INFO | CONTENT |
|--- | --- | --- |
| --  | LOWEST | Collection of others people their posters |
| -  | LOW | Homemade posters (Example: foreign/local media) |
| +  | MEDIUM | Homemade posters (Can easily be exchanged within the same priority) |
| ++  | HIGH | Drazzilb drive (MM2K posters aka our holy grail) |
| +++  | HIGHEST | Custom folder/drive (Personal) |

Whenever a drive contains > 50% posters that are being collected from others, their priority will be set to lowest.

❗ [DAPS](https://github.com/Drazzilb08/daps) has the following priority ranking set: LOW -> HIGH (ASC)

❗❗ Remember, it remains a personal preference when using the recommendations posted below, this only serves as a baseline and is by no means the golden rule.
